# case_study
This repository illustrates the application of swolfpy with the inclusion of social metrics

## Data excel files
The initial social metrics estimates can be found in the file called “Estimated initial data for social metrics”. 
Scenario data can be built based on scenario description. Hence, we are sharing the data for two scenarios. Scenario G which is the one where no improvements are presented and WTE is considered high risk, and Scenario H which illustrates all technologies with a 90% reduction in social metrics.

## Jupyter notebook code
Several scenarios are performed to test these social metrics, hence, jupyter notebooks were prepared for each of the scenarios tested. However, the code utilized in each of the scenarios is similar, with the only variation being the input data. Consequently, we are sharing here two jupyter notebook code from scenario G and H as a template to conduct any other scenario.

## Results - scenarios
The results excel file portraits a summary of scenarios’ results for each of the criterion being optimized, as well as the technology mix selected in each scenario. 
Note that these results could easily be replicated by using the jupyter notebook template code shared and modifying the input data for social metrics according to each scenario description. 

## Note
Full details of the case study conducted to test social metrics will be available soon as a research paper.
